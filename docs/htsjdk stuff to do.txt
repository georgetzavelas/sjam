htsjdk stuff to do
- BerVisibleCompressedString compression/decompression works
- Compression doesn't seem to make the text fields smaller, most likely due to the small size of the field
  compared with the minimum effective compression size
- SJAMFileTest (in the htsjdk module) has the test method to execute
  - src\tests\java\htsjdk\samtools\sjam\SJAMFileTest
  - Read is not working and has not been verified
